The Preservation files have no extra suffix appended to them. Mezzanine and Access files do have an identifying suffix appended to the filename. Collection holders can also provide BAVC with a spreadsheet containing a “Filename Root” field for each tape. If this information is provided the Filename Root will appended to the filename after the barcode. If you prefer that we remove the BAVC Barcode number from the files before delivery please let us know at the start of your project. We’re happy to do this, and require that you provide either your own Unique Identifier or Filename Root for each tape. BAVC can also provide custom suffxes to any file deliverable.

With the correct codec installed,V210 files play in most video playback software and NLE workstations, making it an easy format to work with. The wide adoption of the format makes it a strong contender for long-term viability and support.This file doesn’t generally work well with embedded metadata, and has a small range of preservation-specific features.The largest drawback is the size; Clocking in at 100GB/Hr, V210 files can easily take up multiple terabytes of space for even medium-sized collections. FFV1 . This is an open source, losslessly compressed preservation format. Open source means all the documentation about the format is freely available to read, and the format specification is reviewed and updated transparently by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Lossless means that while the file is compressed, no information is lost during this process, and you’ll be able to store more information with smaller file sizes. The trade-off is that the format is not supported across the board by some playback or NLE software. However, this is changing rapidly and the format is supported by VLC, a free and cross-platform video player. Another advantage of FFV1 is that it supports many preservation-friendly features, such as checksums of video and audio frames and embedded metadata. These files are often around 40GB per hour . ",

ProRes is a high-quality lossy proprietary Apple video format designed to be used in post-production workflows. 422 HQ is a high-bitrate version, which sacrifices a slightly larger file size for a higher quality image. The quality of this format is very good, making it difficult for the regular user to tell the difference between a ProRes Mezzanine file and its accompanying preservation file. We recommend this format for Mezzanine files because of its wide support and higher-quality image. These files are about 30GB per hour . DV25 . DV is a lossy video format. The DV25 version is the most common version of DV, with a bitrate of 25 Mbps.The file size is very small and it works well with NLE software. Unfortunately, the quality is generally worse than ProRes due to a smaller bitrate and the fact that the color space is 4:1:1 or 4:2:0, meaning that there is less color data per pixel. These files are about 12GB per hour . DV50 . Naturally, DV50 has twice the data rate of DV25 at 50 Mbps.Therefore, the quality is greater than DV25, is well-supported, and is still smaller than ProRes. These files are about 25GB per hour . ",

DVPackager is a part of the suite that slipts up dv streams with different attributes contained in a single file. The input is always a DV file. You can use it to package a .dv file as 1 or many .mov files with the following command: . dvpackager -e mov [path/to/file.dv] . You can also run in a folder using this command: . find [path/to/folder] -name \"*.dv\" -not -name \".*\" -exec dvpackager -e mov {} \\; . It’s possible to merge multiple transfers of a tape into a single file to remove errors. You can input as many files as you’d like, as long as they have an overlap in content. You can use this with .dv or .mov files: . dvrescue [path/to/file1.dv] [path/to/file2.dv] [path/to/file3.dv] -m [path/to/OutputFile.dv] . Like iwth QCTools, it’s possible to generate DVRescue reports using the command line. This string will create an .xml report for every .mov file in the current directory. This will make it so that the DVRescue GUI opens instantly.

Most people use archival boxes for the smaller inner box. | Use sturdy boxes and high quality packaging material when packing your tape. Thick bubble-wrap is the best packaging material. You do not need to wrap every tape individually in bubble wrap, as long as there sufficient bubble wrap between the tapes and the box they are packed in. | Do NOT use packing peanuts! They make a mess and do not sufficiently protect tapes during shipping. | Properly packed materials should be snug in the box. If you shake the box you shouldn’t be able to hear or feel the tapes moving around inside of the box. | Orient your tapes vertically, not horizontally! (Remember, Video and Vertical both start with V). This will protect the tapes from damage and misalignment during shipping. | Alway print two shipping labels. Affix one label to the outside of the box, and place the other in the box. That way if the label affixed to the outside falls off, there will be another inside. | Try to keep any box under 30 pounds. A little more is ok, but the heavier the box the more likely it will be mishandled or damaged during shipping. | . ",

You can contact them through their website, and you can also email or call them at: (973) 777-5055. It may be easier and more cost-effective for you to ship those materials directly to New Jersey.

No need to check heads and tails because we do not trim these manually | If any files have been flagged for having a high number of errors during the rip they should be played back to ensure that these errors are not present during playback.

These fields can be easily updated in bulk by clicking the checkbox on the far left side of the list for every record you want to update. Then, when you update each field make sure to click the box that says “Update X selected items” (where “X” is how many records you’ve selected) . | Quality Control Date . | The date that you are performing QC | . | Quality Control Notes . | This should only be filled out if there is a problem.

Ripping CDs Outside of BAVC . If you plan to rip CDs at an institution outside of BAVC you can follow most of the main steps. You’ll still want to use XLD, but you won’t be using Salesforce at all to handle the metadata.

Museums, archives, and libraries will sometimes request an additional Digibeta copy of the digital master file. Part of the Digibeta mastering process is laying down 30 seconds of black, 1 minute of bars/tone, and 30 seconds of black before the picture begins. Set-Up - Clean heads and tape path carefully; use swab to clean the rollers. - Thread a BNC cable out of DIGITAL I/O Serial V/A input directly into the Blackmagic Capture Card - Set Remote part of patch bay from Kona to Digibeta. - Video Patch - Digibeta–&gt;VDA1 - Audio Patch - Digibeta –&gt; RANE Mix - Find a blank tape of the right length. They are stored in a filing cabinet in the tape closet. - Open Media Express and import the file you are mastering to tape. - Pack the tape by fast-forwarding and rewinding. - Ensure the tape is wound to the beginning before laying down timecode. Lay Black and Timecode - Switch deck to “Setup 1” by opening the control panel to reveal advance settings. Turn the deck off and back on again to activate. - Set the “TG Generator” to “interior” and “preset.” - Press the “hold” button that is underneath the timecode panel. - Set timecode to 00:58:00 - Press “Jog” and use the knob to move between the sections of the timecode. Set the numbers by pressing “Jog” at the same time as the knob is turned. - Press “Set” button under timecode. - Test by pressing REC - Pres REC + PLAY to record black and let run past 01:00:00 - Stop .

The tape will automatically stop when the file ends. - Check to make sure blacks, bars, and file all begin at the established in/out points. Labeling tba . Tips/Troubleshooting - Do not use Media Express at the same time as you are recording blacks. You might accidentally record the file prematurely. - The file should be imported from the computer’s local storage drive, not the presraid. Importing from the presraid will result in dropped frames.

    "content": "Github Etiquitte . Now that you have the repo clone and a local instance running on your computer you can make changes to the documentation and see them happen in real time before they’re pushed to the main branch in the remote repository. Proper GitHub etiquitte states that any changes you make should made to your own branch. When you’re ready for these changes to be made to the main branch (what you see on the public website) you should create a Pull Request, which pulls your changes into the main branch. So, the first thing you need to do is create your own branch. Here’s an article about creating a new branch using Atom or the command line. Once you’ve created a new branch you can push all the changes you want to this branch. Remember, the workflow for this is as follows: . | Make changes to the files | Stage the changes | Commit the changes with a helpful description/message | Push the changes to your branch. | . Once you’re happy with all the changes you’ve pushed you can make a Pull Request. Someone else on your team should review the Pull Request, then will confirm that it’s all ok, and then it will Merged into the main branch of the remote repository. Making changes to the documentation . The documentation lives in text files that in the Markdown language. The TemplateArticle.md file contains all the different ways you can use Markdown to make pretty and readable documentation. The files are best edited in a program like Atom or Visual Studio Code. These programs are a little confusing at first, so if you’re lost you should watch a YouTube tutorial about them (as an added bonus, these programs integrate Git features like commits and pull requests into their GUIs). Once you have a good editing environment setup all you have to do edit the text in the documents. Once you save the files you’ll see the updates reflected instantly in your local instance. Adding a new Article . Articles all live in the /docs/ folder, which is located in the root level of the repository. Inside docs there are a bunch of subfolders. Each of these subfolders represents a category of articles on the website. Inside each subfolder are a bunch of .md files. These files each correspond to an article. To make a new article you can simply copy an existing article, or copy the TemplateArticle.md file. Make sure you nest the new article in its associated subfolder, and that you update layout, title, and parent information at the top of the document. Adding a new subfolder / categeory . To add a new subfolder or category, you’ll need to add a new subfolder to the docs folder. You’ll also need to create a new index.md file inside of that folder. The index.md file is critical, as it tells the website that this new folder corresponds to a new category, and creates a landing page for that category. To make creating a new folder easier, you can just duplicate and rename the TemplateFolder directory. Just make sure you rename the folder, and rename title info in the header of the index.md file within that folder. ",

    "content": "QC Overview . | Quality Control(QC) procedures occur in all phases of our workflow for conserving magnetic media and migrating the content to digital formats. This document provides guidelines for the QC technician to properly assess the integrity of Transfer Technicians’ work in transferring analog media. The purpose of QC in our organization is four-fold: . | QC will ensure that only the highest quality files and documentation are delivered to the client | QC will ensure that all equipment is functioning as expected | QC will ensure that workflows and tasks are being performed as expected | QC will help tell us where to focus resources | . | . While errors will be found on a file-by-file basis, analysis of QC data can help us holistically improve the quality of our work. Keep in mind that communication between the QC Technician and the Transfer Technician is very important when discussing files for review. | Below are a few key guidelines for performing QC: . | QC Should be performed by someone other than the Transfer Technician | QC should be performing as soon as possible following transfer | QC should be performed before loading files to the delivery media | QC should be performed on the Storage Area Network (SAN) | QC should be performed before deleting any files from the SAN | Any QC fails or issues found by the QC Technician should be addressed by the Transfer Technician | . | . QC Software . | Salesforce . | A web-app used for tracking our work. Each tape is represented as a Preservation Object within an Opportunity. Salesforce allows us to create reports that can give us an overview of tasks and workflows. | . | QuickTime 7 . | Playback software used for QC. Other playback software exists, and can be useful for troubleshooting, but this is the main software to be used during QC. | . | QCTools . | An open-source app built specifically for performing QC on digitized a/v content. The software on its own does not perform QC, but provides the user with data visualizations and playback filters that can help them perform QC. | . | MediaConch . | An open-source app used to analyse files through a series of BAVC specific policies, ensuring file specifications are correct. | . | . QC Reports . | These reports can be found by clicking on the Reports tab in Salesforce, then clicking on the Preservation: Quality Control folder on the left-hand side of the screen.
