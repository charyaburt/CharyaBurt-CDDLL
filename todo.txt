discuss taxonomy in documentation (what is an album vs a video? why?)

add google drive functionality for albums

One thing: for dependency paths, can you also document where we need to manually change the python3 path?

And if you don't mind, you can also mention that from macOS Big Sur (I think) the path seems to be opt/homebrew/bin for all the dependencies.

future thoughts: handling programs/events? more dance-specific objects?
