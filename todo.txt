Create vimeo record updater so we can batch edit vimeo Records

probably should rewrite vimeo mass uploader since i'm handling airtable records better now and it shouldn't crash

How about this: as long as it's NOT marked "Test Record" "Empty Record" or "Deaccessioned Record", it's considered "In Library".
