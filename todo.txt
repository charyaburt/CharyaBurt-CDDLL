harvest metadata besides checksum.
possibly find a way to deal with access files.
   my idea here is to name access files in a way that they come second in the folder nest, then it's not a problem
   or alternatively, have the script know to ignore access files? idk?

need access files creator!! can be simple, just copy over size and aspect, deinterlace nad make h264

need to deinterlace all interlaced files

Work on documentation!
   Really need to deep dive into how to properly nest and create access files
   so...i made a new field for the access copy Filenames

add a thing that harvests access copy filenames if they exist in the vimeo upload!!
