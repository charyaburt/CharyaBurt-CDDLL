## random thoughts that need to be fleshed output

- Vimeo is very strict about weekly upload limits. If you plan to upload a huge archive to vimeo you should pay for a month of the top tier subscription, upload everything during that month, and then downgrade.
- You should be running record maintenance and access maintenance every month on a schedule
- If the drive audits and file audits return errors you need to fix these right away. It's probably something minor, but don't let it get out of hand
